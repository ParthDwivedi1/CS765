1. Take the Payment.sol file and place it inside the contracts folder,
    inside the folder where truffle init has been run.

2. Run ganache-cli in a terminal.

3. Run truffle migrate to deploy the contract
    (Make sure to change the name of the deployed contract to 
     Payment)

4. Take the address of the deployed contract and paste it in the
    clients.py file.
