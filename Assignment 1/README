PEERS - Number of peers
SLOW - Percentage of peers which are slow
LOWCPU - Percentage of peers which are lowcpu
MEANTRANSACTIONTIME - Average inter arrival time between transactions
MEANBLOCKTIME - Average interarrival time between blocks

Starts out by printing the initialization tasks that the task list is initialized with.
Then prints a description of the task under consideration and the tasks that were added due to this.
