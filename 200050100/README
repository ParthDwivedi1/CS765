CS765 Assignment 2

Selfish/Stubborn Mining Attack

Depending on what attack we wish to simulate, enter the appropriate directory.
Then run simulator.py using the below command.

Usage: python simulator.py [--peers PEERS] [--slow SLOW] [--lowcpu LOWCPU] [--meantransactiontime MEANTRANSACTIONTIME] [--meanblocktime MEANBLOCKTIME] [--attackerpower ATTACKERPOWER] [--attackerspeed ATTACKERSPEED] [-attackerconnections ATTACKERCONNECTIONS]

# Parameter Definition

PEERS - Number of peers
SLOW - Percentage of peers which are slow
LOWCPU - Percentage of peers which are lowcpu
MEANTRANSACTIONTIME - Average inter arrival time between transactions
MEANBLOCKTIME - Average interarrival time between blocks
ATTACKERPOWER - The percentage of hashing power with the attacker
ATTACKERSPEED - Whether the attacker is a slow (0) or fast node (1) 
ATTACKERCONNECTIONS - Percentage of nodes to which the attacker is connected

# Description of the output

Starts out by printing the initialization tasks that the task list is initialized with.
Then prints a description of the task under consideration and the tasks that were added due to this.

# Sample Command that can be copied

python simulator.py --peers 100 --slow 50 --lowcpu 100 --meantransactiontime 10000000 --meanblocktime 1000 --attackerpower 50 --attackerspeed 1 --attackerconnections 50 > output.txt

# Design Flow Document

It is divided into two parts - One for honest nodes and one for the attacker node.

For honest nodes, the flow is as in the previous assignment.

For the attacker node, the flow when a block is generated and when a block is received slightly changes,
which is outlined in the new flowchart. For other procedures, the flow remains as for honest nodes.
